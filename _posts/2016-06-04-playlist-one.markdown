**Commentary**: The theme of this mix was to weave effortlessly between downtempo and uptempo dance/house with generally funky instrumentation. While most of the tracks arguably arenâ€™t mainstream electronic tracks from big names, they all are incredibly accessible due to their catchy melodies and vocal features. They can certainly be shuffled around, but the current order allows for slight callbacks between every other track. With 'Sunshine' and 'On the Regular,' there's a great use of offbeat cowbell/woodblock samples. 'Fort Knox' and 'Hold Tight' are both by Goldfish, and while using two tracks from the same artist isn't the best display of versatility, there's no denying their fit. Finally, the last three tracks are rooted deeply in downtempo, spacey atmospheres with sensual female vocals that you can't help but bob your head to. Whether you're on the dancefloor or just getting pumped up for a night out, these tracks are perfect to get things started.

Additional fits for the mix would include Disclosure tracks ['White Noise'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkk2H3Ztrfk) or ['F For You,'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TUIciKQzxI) or the incredibly hot remix of [The Jackson 5's 'I Want You Back' by Shaparder & LRX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHpgJLYqWSY).
