**Commentary**: Again, there's nothing I like more than to introduce my friends to underground artists through tie-ins with more mainstream tracks. This small collection is geared toward the current trap-influenced festival scene (think Major Lazer, Baauer, RL Grime, Flosstradamus, etc.) with a curveball thrown in. These tracks blur the line between hip-hop (with shoutouts to Missy Elliott and Pharrell) and electronic-influenced trap, but even the three songs without vocals keep their feet in the door for mainstream audiences by connecting well with the others. The oddball track here is Feed Me's 'Pink Lady,' which clearly is the reach track. Its tempo works well in the playlist, and the clearly old-school dubstep drops feel nostalgic yet perfectly appropriate nestled with the rest of these ratchet trap tunes.

Additional fits for the mix would include [Flosstradamus' remix of Major Lazer's 'Original Don,'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnsgDTGIQN4) [VESTIGE's remix of Sage The Gemini's 'Gas Pedal,'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf0sWwJsems) or anything by Troyboi, who has recently received attention by being featured on Missy Elliott's WTF Remixes release.
